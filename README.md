# Solidity-AirBNB-Booking
Solidity AirBNB Booking project for university

This contract allows users to book accommodations for a certain number of nights by specifying the check-in and check-out dates. The contract calculates the total price based on the price per night set by the owner. Users can cancel their bookings, and the contract owner can mark bookings as completed. The contract ensures that bookings don't overlap, and it emits events for booking creation, cancellation, and completion.
